Postmortem Report: Ubuntu Container's Nginx Installation Failure

Date: Sunday 14th May 2023

Overview:
On Friday 12th May 2023, at exactly 3:08pm to 4:12pm WAT, an attempt was made to install Nginx on an Ubuntu container running on a Docker host. The installation failed, and this report aims to provide an analysis of the root cause of the failure.

Incident Description:
During the installation of Nginx, the package manager returned an error stating that it could not find the package. Despite trying to refresh the package cache and reattempting the installation, the error persisted.

Root Cause:
After conducting an investigation, it was discovered that the issue was caused by an outdated package repository on the container. The package repository on the Ubuntu container had not been updated in a while, and as a result, it did not have the latest Nginx package.

Resolution:
To resolve the issue, we updated the package repository on the container using the following command:
sudo apt-get update

After updating the package repository, we reattempted the installation of Nginx, and this time, it was successful.

Lessons Learned:
The incident highlighted the importance of regularly updating package repositories to ensure that the latest packages are available for installation. Going forward, we will incorporate this into our standard procedures to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.

Additionally, the incident served as a reminder of the importance of testing installations and configurations before deploying them into production environments. In this case, if we had tested the installation of Nginx before deploying it, we would have discovered the outdated package repository earlier and avoided the installation failure altogether.

Conclusion:
Overall, the Nginx installation failure on the Ubuntu container was caused by an outdated package repository. By updating the package repository, we were able to resolve the issue and successfully install Nginx. Going forward, we will incorporate regular updates of package repositories into our standard procedures and prioritize testing installations and configurations before deploying them into production environments.
